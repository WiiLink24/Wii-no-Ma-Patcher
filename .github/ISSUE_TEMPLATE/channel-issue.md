1. What happened?
<!-- For example, watching a video repeatedly crashes the console. -->

2. What did you expect to happen?
<!-- For example, the video should have continued playing. -->

3. What error did you encounter?
<!-- If it doesn't provide an error number, tell us what issue happened. -->

4. How can we reproduce this issue?
<!-- Say as detailed as possible - instead of "watched video", tell us the name of the video you watched and when you got the error. For example, "I got error 354116 after opening the Doge poster in the room to watch the video 'Testing'." -->


<!-- If you want, include a screenshot or picture! That helps us greatly as well. -->
